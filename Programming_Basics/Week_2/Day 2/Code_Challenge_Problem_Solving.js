// A computer application needs to be able to identify if a written paragraph is written in First, Second, or Third Person 
// (check out the following if you'd like a refresher on First, Second, and Third Person 
// https://www.grammarly.com/blog/first-second-and-third-person/#:~:text=Many%20stories%20and%20novels%20are,unfold%20through%20that%20character's%20eyes.).



// Using comments, write out 1 strategy that could be used to solve the problem.
// (Search for keywords)
//First Person (I We)
//Second Person (You)
//Third Person (He,She,It,They)



// Using comments, create pseudo-code to apply one of the strategies to solve the problem. 

// var text = ("We could do ourselves a favor and make a reservation for our group.")  
// if (text = "I", "We") 
// console.log ("First Person")
//     if (text = "You") 
//     console.log ("Second Person") 
//     else (text = "He", "She", "It", "They")
//     console.log ("Third Person")

// var text = 0

// Using comments, write a short paragraph that answers: What is the hardest part of problem-solving? 

// The hardest part of problem solving is the process going through each example to try to find the answer that works for what your going with. Sometimes you may never even find the answer like up above I struggled with this one and still didn't come up with a correct answer to solve my issue but I layed out the process of what was going through my headwhile trying to code out the problem.
