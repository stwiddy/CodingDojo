// COPY (ctrl/cmd + c)
console.log("Copy me!");

// PASTE (ctrl/cmd + v)
// Paste your copied console log below:

console.log("Cut me out!");
console.log("I should be above 'cut me out' if you did this right!");

// alt + arrow keys moves code up and down, also pays attention to indentation



// SAVE YOUR WORK!!

// SWITCH BETWEEN WINDOWS (alt/option + tab)
// This is useful for quickly switching between VSCode and your web browser or anything else you have open
// Remember to HOLD alt then TAP tab until you highlight the window you want to see
// Try it out! Switch from VSCode to your browser or anything else you have open and back again

// CREATE MULTIPLE CURSORS (alt/option + left click)
// Creating multiple cursors is useful when you want to add the same thing to several different places
         console.log("Hello, my name is shaun ")
// Hold alt/option then left click here ^ (inside the quotation)

   console.log("Hello, my name is shaun ")
// Hold alt then left click here ^ (inside the quotation)

   console.log("Hello, my name is shaun ")
// Hold alt then left click here ^ (inside the quotation)

   console.log("Hello, my name is shaun ")
// Hold alt then left click here ^ (inside the quotation)

   console.log("Hello, my name is shaun ")
// Hold alt then left click here ^ (inside the quotation)

// Once you see 6 blinking cursors, type your name!

// SAVE YOUR WORK!!

// SELECT MULTIPLES OF THE SAME THING (highlight a word, then ctrl/cmd + d)
console.log("Did you know.... Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness. Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision are much better than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six times their length. Cats will also rule our society if we let them. Cats are very good at training humans to do their bidding. Cats are also not the only thing capable of these feats. If you can properly select and change all instances of 'Cats' in this sentence, anything can fit these descriptions. But you don't want to have to read and reread this entire thing looking for every instance of the word 'Cats', that's what ctrl/cmd + d is for. Just make sure you first highlight the first instance of 'Cats' by double left clicking on the word. Notice how it subtly highlights all the other instances of 'Cats' on the document? That's because they're watching. Hold down ctrl or cmd and keep hitting the d key until all instances of 'Cats' are brightly highlighted. Then you can hit the backspace key and type in whatever you want. There are exactly 13 'Cats' in this paragraph (watch out, bad luck!), can you change them all without doing it by hand?");

// SAVE YOUR WORK!!

// Find a particular word
// crtl/cmd + f
// Sometimes you don't want to change a word...you just want to find it. In which case crtl/cmd + f is your best friend for FINDING said word. Go back to that massive paragraph above and use crtl/cmd + f to find the words:
// peripheral
// entire
// training
// luck

// Comment out your code
// ctrl/cmd + / 
// Highlight the lines you want to comment out then hit the ctrl/cmd + / key to comment those lines out

// Highlight these lines
// They should really be commented out, see how the highlighting is all weird right now?
// So left click and drag to highlight these lines
// Then hit ctrl/cmd + / to comment this out
// You'll be glad you did

// Undo your last move
// ctrl/cmd + z
// Any time you make a mistake, try hitting ctrl/cmd + z to undo your mistake
// Super useful if you accidentally change or delete a lot of code and need to go back a few steps!
// Start writing anything down here, then just start hitting ctrl/cmd + z and see what it does


// Okay lightning round!! If you make mistakes, use UNDO to step back, don't just overwrite your code!

console.log("Paste that 'Copy me' under me!");
